## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) - A modular toolkit for React
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Static typing for JS
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - A build tool for modern
- [ZOD](https://zod.dev/) - TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

Through this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of state management, learning not only how to structure and update application state effectively but also how to implement advanced strategies to ensure data consistency across components. I developed skills in schema validation to enforce data integrity, using tools like Zod to define, check, and transform incoming data. Working with TypeScript allowed me to type data precisely, enhancing code reliability and preventing runtime errors, while improving code readability for team collaboration.

Additionally, I became proficient in leveraging various tools and features offered by the framework, learning to synchronize them seamlessly to build a cohesive application architecture. Perhaps most importantly, I mastered the process of deploying on Netlify with server functions. This experience gave me valuable insight into setting up and managing backend functionalities within a serverless environment, optimizing deployment workflows, and handling production configurations to deliver a fully functional and scalable web application

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of serverless functions and deployment workflows. While I have a solid foundation in deploying with platforms like Netlify, I’d like to explore advanced configuration, particularly around optimizing for scalability and performance. Additionally, I want to further refine my skills in state management, focusing on handling more complex data flows and asynchronous operations with efficiency. I’m also interested in perfecting schema validation techniques, especially in crafting reusable and adaptable schemas for diverse data structures, to enhance data integrity across applications.
